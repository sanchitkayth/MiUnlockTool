# MiUnlockTool
This is Unofficial Mi Unlock Tool by Sanchit kay5h. This tool helps you to unlock bootloader of xiaomi devices. I made this tool because in some cases xiaomi doesn't provide verification code.
This tool it executable so you don't need to install python or other file. This tool manage all files by it-self.
steps to unlock bootloader:- 
*you need to successfully bind up xiaomi account in mi unlock status.
*turn your device in fastboot mode.
*open this tool and login with same account.
*follow steps that are shown on tool.


In some cases this tool doesn't format user data but i suggest to take a backup first.
In some cases this tool bypass the waiting list but i am not sure if it bypass in all cases.
